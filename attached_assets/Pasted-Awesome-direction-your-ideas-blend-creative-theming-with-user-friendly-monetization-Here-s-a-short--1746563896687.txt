Awesome direction—your ideas blend creative theming with user-friendly monetization. Here's a short, structured guide to help you stay focused and execute everything smoothly:

---

## 🎯 **Minecraft Texture Pack Store Setup Guide**

---

### 1. 🛠️ **Project Preparation**

* [ ] **Define your product tiers**:

  * Free 32x32 version (publicly downloadable)
  * \$6 “Current + 2 Updates”
  * \$22 Lifetime access
  * Tip Jar (suggest: \$2, \$5, \$10 tiers)
* [ ] Write product descriptions, version numbers, and a “starter kit” install guide (PDF/video)
* [ ] Set up a basic product metadata JSON or DB model (SKU, price, tier, Stripe ID, etc.)

---

### 2. 🧾 **Stripe Integration**

* [ ] Create a Stripe account and generate API keys.
* [ ] Set up Stripe Products and Prices in your Stripe dashboard (or dynamically via API).
* [ ] Use Stripe Checkout to handle:

  * One-time payments
  * Coupons (via Stripe Dashboard or API)
  * Receipts
* [ ] Add webhook handling for successful payments to trigger download link delivery.

**Tools**:
→ [`stripe/stripe-node`](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-node)
→ [`@stripe/stripe-js`](https://stripe.com/docs/js)

---

### 3. 🧩 **Storefront UI (Crafting Table Themed)**

* [ ] Create a “Crafting Table” grid UI:

  * Use a 3x3 drag-and-drop interface (e.g., [`@dnd-kit/core`](https://dndkit.com/) or `react-beautiful-dnd`)
  * Each store item is a draggable "ingredient"
  * Central grid slot = “crafting output” aka cart
* [ ] Once something is “crafted,” animate a “Purchase” button appearing
* [ ] Add hover tooltips (like Minecraft) for price, description, version, etc.

---

### 4. 🛍️ **Cart & Checkout Flow**

* [ ] Dragging to the center slot = "add to cart"
* [ ] Clicking "Purchase" launches Stripe Checkout (with relevant product)
* [ ] After success, redirect to a custom Thank You page with:

  * Receipt
  * Download links
  * License info

---

### 5. 🧾 **Orders & Coupons**

* [ ] Create a backend `/orders` route (e.g., `/api/orders`) to store user emails + products bought (only from webhook, not client-side)
* [ ] Allow re-access via email or temporary token
* [ ] Build coupon management (via Stripe Dashboard or API) for promo codes or discounts

---

### 6. 📦 **Starter Kit & Delivery**

* [ ] Zip the Starter Kit bundle (64x64 + PBR + mod instructions + install guide)
* [ ] Upload securely (e.g., AWS S3, Supabase Storage, or Vercel Serverless files)
* [ ] Only serve downloads after successful Stripe webhook confirms payment

---

### 7. 🖼️ **Marketing & Trust**

* [ ] Add visual comparison between 32x32 and 64x64 versions
* [ ] Testimonials section
* [ ] “How it works” mini-guide + animated walkthrough of crafting store

---

### 🔒 Extra Tips

* Use reCAPTCHA on download buttons or forms
* For bonus polish: let users “name their price” for the tip jar

Would you like me to mock up a visual wireframe of the crafting-table-style store layout or help generate any starter code (Next.js + Stripe)?
